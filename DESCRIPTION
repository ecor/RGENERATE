Title: RGENERATE A tool for generation random variable time series using the
    tools of 'vars' or 'RMAWGEN'
Type: Package
Author: Emanuele Cordano
Description: A method `generate` is implemented in this package for the random
    generation of vector time series according to models obtained by `RMAWGEN`,
    `vars` or other packages.  This package was created to generalize `RMAWGEN`
    algorithms for the analysis and generation of any environmental vector time
    series.
